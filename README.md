Final Year Project
=====

My final year project for the Computer Science course in Trinity College Dublin.

The project is assessing the performance of 3 machine learning algorithms for topic-modelling and text clustering.

The algorithms being investigated are:
* LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation)
* KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours)
* Word2Vec
